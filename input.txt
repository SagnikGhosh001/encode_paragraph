In a quiet town tucked between two silver rivers lived an old clockmaker named Bram. His shop was tiny—barely more than a doorway and a window—but inside it ticked a thousand tiny hearts. Every clock he made was special, though no one could quite say why. One winter evening, a little girl named Lira wandered into his shop, clutching a broken pocket watch that had belonged to her late mother. “I can’t fix this one,” Bram said gently after examining it. “But I can give you something else.” He disappeared into the back room and returned with a small wooden box. Inside was a clock no larger than a teacup, carved with stars that glowed faintly blue. “This one doesn’t count minutes,” he said. “It counts memories. Every time your heart feels something worth keeping, it will chime.” Lira took it home. That night, the tiny clock rang once—softly—when she remembered her mother’s laugh. It chimed again the next morning as sunlight warmed her blanket. Over the years it marked every important moment: her first friend, her first heartbreak, her first victory. When Lira grew old, the little memory clock was worn and faded, but full—so full it hummed constantly, a lifetime preserved. And somewhere back in the quiet town, Bram the clockmaker smiled, knowing that some clocks don’t measure time at all, only the things that make life worth living.
